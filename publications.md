I publish papers in AI and ML conferences (e.g., UAI, NeurIPS, AAAI).
Within the scope of causal inference, I investigated the problem of **causal effect identifiability** <button type="button" class="btn btn-set1-1">ID</button> allowing what a causal inference engine can take. In parallel, I also studied on the identifiability problem for heterogeneous domains (similar to the underlying ideas of domain adaptation or transfer learning in ML) called **transportability** <button type="button" class="btn btn-set1-2">TR</button>. I also pursue research in **decision-making** <button type="button" class="btn btn-set1-3">DM</button> where causality serves as the first principle to solve the problem.
During my PhD study, I mostly spent time on understanding causal discovery from **relational data** <button type="button" class="btn btn-set1-4">REL</button> such as relational conditional independence, relational Markov equivalence classes, relational causal discovery algorithms both theoretical and practical.
