	I am an <b>Assistant Professor</b> in the <a href="https://gsds.snu.ac.kr">Graduate School of Data Science</a> at <a href="https://www.snu.ac.kr">Seoul National University</a>, directing Causality Lab <img src="/assets/logo_2023.png" height="16" style="vertical-align: baseline"/>. Prior to joining Seoul National University, 
	I was an 
	Associate Research Scientist at Columbia University and Postdoctoral Research Associate at Computer Science, Purdue University
	working with Prof. <a href="http://causalai.net">Elias Bareinboim</a>.
	I got my Ph.D. in College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/vhonavar/index.htm">Vasant Honavar</a>.
</p>
Currently, I am working on the theory and application of causality from the perspectives of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science. In particular, I am interested in causal discovery, sequential decision-making, and the identifiability and estimation of causal effects in diverse settings.
During my Ph.D. study, I focused on causal discovery in a relational domain.<br>

## Research Interests

- **Causal Inference** (how can we identify and estimate the effect of an intervention?),  **Causal Decision Making** (how can we utilize causal information in decision making?),  **Causal Discovery** (how can we establish causal relationships from complex data?) 
- (Future) Developing theories and applications for *health* and *social* domains with causality as a first principle. Developing robust machine learning models and algorithms utilizing causal knowledge. Artificial general intelligence and causality (how can an agent equip a causal mindset. how to counterfactually reason about its actions and consequences.)
