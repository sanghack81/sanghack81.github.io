	I am an <b>Assistant Professor</b> in the <a href="https://gsds.snu.ac.kr">Graduate School of Data Science</a> at <a href="https://www.snu.ac.kr">Seoul National University</a>. Prior to joining Seoul National University, 
	I was an 
	Associate Research Scientist at Columbia University and Postdoctoral Research Associate at Computer Science, Purdue University
	working with Prof. <a href="http://causalai.net">Elias Bareinboim</a>.
	I got my Ph.D. in College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/vhonavar/index.htm">Vasant Honavar</a>.

Currently, I am working on developing methods for applying causality in sequential decision-making
and developing theory of causal effect identifiability and transportability.
During my Ph.D. study, I focused on causal discovery in a relational domain.<br>

## Research Interests

- **Causal Inference** (how can we identify the effect of an intervention?),  **Causal Decision Making** (how can we utilize causal information in decision making?),  **Causal Discovery** (how can we establish causal relationships from complex data?) 
- (Future) Developing theories and applications for *health* and *social* domains with causality as a first principle by bringing ideas from *economics*. Developing robust machine learning algorithms utilizing causal knowledge.
