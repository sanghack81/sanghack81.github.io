	I am an <b>Associate Research Scientist</b> at <b>Columbia University</b>  working with Prof. <a href="http://causalai.net">Elias Bareinboim</a>. Prior to joining Columbia University, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Computer Science, Purdue University.
I got my Ph.D. in College of Information Sciences and Technology (with computer science background), Pennsylvania State University, University Park, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/vhonavar/index.htm">Vasant Honavar</a>.
</p>
Currently, I am working on developing methods for applying causality in sequential decision-making
and developing theory of causal effect identifiability and transportability.
During my Ph.D. study, I focused on causal discovery in relational domain.
